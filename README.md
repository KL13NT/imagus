# Zoomit!

Zoomit is created by [Nabil Tharwat](https://iamnabil.netlify.app) and is
licensed under GNU GPLv3. Source code can be found on the public [GitHub
Repository](https://github.com/KL13NT/zoomit#readme).

## Motivation

I used to use a browser extension by the name Imagus until my browser
started lagging noticeably and I discovered that Imagus was the culprit.
I researched a bit and found out about its source code situation and the
horrors that lie within. I have nothing but full respect for the person
behind it, but I just couldn't let that code drag my browsing experience
down.

Imagus also isn't open-source and so I couldn't completely trust it
knowing it had access to all my tabs, further, when I looked at the code
posted by others online I couldn't understand a single thing and
therefore was unable to refactor or improve on it, hence why I created a
new extension from scratch that does the same job, only better. ðŸ¤ž

## Features

- Zoomit can enlarge images, gifs, and videos! Although support for
  videos is still experimental and basic it should work for some handy
  use-cases.
- Zoomit supports a number of default websites that can be listed by
  clicking the popup on your browser's toolbar.
- Zoomit allows you to easily add or remove support for websites of your
  liking through the same listing popup. You can add a new website or path
  through the form there and delete any support you like by clicking the
  trash icon.
- Zoomit will always try to load the highest quality it can when
  enlarging.

## Upcoming Features

- Support for keyboard shortcuts: This will allow you to control the
  display of enlarged media through the keyboard. Scenarios in mind
  include things like enlarging images only when a certain key is
  held-down.
- Free zoom mode: Free zoom is a feature in which you can enlarge some
  media and zoom freely on it in an overlay separate from the page itself.
  This feature depends on keyboard shortcuts and will land later.
- Video controls: Enlarging and playing videos sounds fun, but playing
  AND controlling videos is much more fun!

## Help and Feature Requests

I work on this project on my own in my spare time so questions and
feature requests may take some time to be answered. The official support
channel currently is GitHub only. I'm considering creating a Discord
server.

## Support

I work on this project in my free time. It's completely open-source and
free-to-use. Supporting me by sponsoring me on
GitHub would greatly motivate me to work on requests!
